PREMISE
   Once upon a time, a little penguin called Bobo lost his favorite bubble blower.  After extensive investigation, Bobo discovers that the neighborhood bully, Big Billy, had stolen Bobo’s toy out of jealousy.  Thus, Bobo embarks on a journey to find Big Billy and take back his bubble blower.  Along the way, Bobo must defeat Big Billy’s evil henchmen (whom he had coerced into working for him).  Help little Bobo on his journey to find his bubble blower!  Good luck!
